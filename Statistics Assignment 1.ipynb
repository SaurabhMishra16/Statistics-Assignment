    "There are two main types of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involves the collection, organization, presentation, and summary of data. It focuses on describing the main features of a dataset, such as central tendency, dispersion, and shape. Descriptive statistics are used to provide a clear and concise understanding of the data.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you have collected the heights (in centimeters) of a group of individuals. Descriptive statistics can be used to calculate the average height (mean), the spread of heights (standard deviation), and the range of heights. Additionally, graphical representations like histograms or box plots can be used to visually summarize the distribution of heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involves making inferences and generalizations about a population based on a sample. It uses probability theory and statistical techniques to draw conclusions and make predictions. Inferential statistics allow us to make statements about a larger population based on the analysis of a smaller sample.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to know the average income of all employees in a company, but surveying the entire population is impractical. You can take a random sample of employees and use inferential statistics to estimate the average income of the entire population. Techniques such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing can be employed to determine the level of certainty or significance of the estimates."

    "If the researchers attempt to calculate the mean of teaching methods (e.g., assigning numerical values to each method), it would imply a false numerical relationship or significance between the teaching methods. For example, if they assign values such as 1 for Method A, 2 for Method B, and 3 for Method C, it does not imply that Method C is three times better than Method A.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Level of Measurement:\n",
    "Nominal Data: Nominal data is the lowest level of measurement. It represents data in categories or labels that do not have any inherent order or ranking. Nominal data can only be classified into different groups or categories.\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data is the second level of measurement. It represents data that can be ordered or ranked. The categories in ordinal data have a relative position or rank, but the differences between categories may not be uniform or quantifiable.\n",

It uses probability theory and statistical techniques to draw conclusions beyond the immediate data available. Inferential statistics allows researchers to make statements about populations based on the information obtained from a representative sample.\n",

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is the most common measure of central tendency. It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of observations. The mean represents the average value of the data and provides a measure of the center.\n",

    "3. Mode: The mode is the value(s) that occur most frequently in the dataset. It represents the peak or highest point of the distribution and is useful for categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread or variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies the spread of the data around the mean, with higher variance indicating greater variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of data points from the mean and provides a more interpretable measure of spread. It is commonly used because it is in the same units as the data.\n",
